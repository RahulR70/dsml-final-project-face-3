## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to recognize handwritten digits. The dataset contains features extracted from images of handwritten digits, and the target variable is the digit label (0-9). The project includes:

- Data preprocessing and feature selection.
- Model building using various machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation using classification metrics.
- Hyperparameter tuning for the best-performing model.
